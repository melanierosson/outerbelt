# The Outerbelt Alliance NFP
This repo is for The Outerbelt Alliance NFP's new website, to be hosted at https://outerbelt.org/

## Goals
* Educate the public about the Outerbelt (e.g. its existence and how to easily navigate it)
* Advocate for the trail to become a nationally registered hiking trail (by making it known to the general public)
* Provide resources and tools that will further enable the trail to be accessible to all (e.g. trail maps, hiker reviews, etc.)
