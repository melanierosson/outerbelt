# The Outerbelt Alliance NFP
This repo is for The Outerbelt Alliance NFP's new website, to be hosted at https://outerbelt.org/

## Goals
* Educate the public about the Outerbelt (e.g. its existence and how to easily navigate it)
* Advocate for the trail to become a nationally registered hiking trail (by making it known to the general public)
* Provide resources and tools that will further enable the trail to be accessible to all (e.g. trail maps, hiker reviews, etc.)

## Tools
* Figma
* Adobe XD
* Adobe Illustrator

## Process
* We held a few discussions with the client to clarify the organization's needs, including the features are required on the new website, what style of branding they're aiming for, etc.
* We each made mood boards to represent concepts we believed could work for Outerbelt's new branding, then we combined the color palettes and waited to see what would mix best with the new logo
* Then we each sketched logo ideas, collaborated on our favorites, and vectorized them to present to the client
* We each worked on desktop front-page wireframes and are now in the process of combining the best features/layouts into a single wireframe
* Currently, we believe Wordpress would be the best development approach to take for the website, but we're waiting to hear more about budgetary requirements
